    "text": "Hockey is often referred to as one of the more difficult sports to exist. You need to know how to skate with knives on your feet, shoot a rubber biscuit up to 90 mph all while 5 guys try to knock your head off. For Wayne Gretzky, he made hockey look as easy as blinking your eyes. Known as “The Great One”, Gretzky played 20 years in the world’s toughest hockey league, the NHL.\nBy the end of his marvelous career, Gretzky owned or shared 61 records in the NHL, the most in the history of the league. The record he’s most renown for is his career point total. In just under 1500 games, The Great One recorded a mind-boggiling 2,857 points. Every season he was putting up outrageous numbers. He reached the 200 point mark in a season four times. Not a single other player in the leagues history has been able to reach that number. For 20 years in the league, his numbers are off the charts.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ngreat <- read_csv(\"GretzkyStats.csv\")\n\nstats <- great %>%\n  filter(Tm == \"LAK\" |\n         Tm == \"EDM\" |\n         Tm == \"NYR\") %>%\n filter(PTS < 248) %>%\ngroup_by(Season) %>%\nsummarise(\n    TotalGoals = sum(G),\n    TotalAssists = sum(A)\n)\n\nbigwide <- stats %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Points\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=bigwide, aes(x=Season, weight=Points, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#041E42\", \"#FF4c00\"), labels=c(\"Assists\", \"Goals\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\",\n    y=\"Total Points\",\n    title=\"Wayne Gretzky's Season Stats\",\n    subtitle=\"The GOAT of Hockey played 20 seasons in the NHL.\",\n    caption=\"Source: HockeyReference | By Keegan Olivera\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 24, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n2,857 career points. 14 100-point seasons, EVERY season above a point-per-game. There’s a reason they call him “The Great One”.\nMany sport fans consider this record as “unbreakable”. The player closest to Gretzky, Jaromír Jágr, is still 936 points behind him. He was so good that if you subtracted all the goals in his career, he would still be first in all-time points. But hockey has been evolving over the last few years. In the late 90s and early 2000s, hockey was a grit and grind game. Teams were made up of big goons who could knock anyone on your team into an emergency room. The game has transitioned into skill over strength. Nobody in the league has the skill like Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid.\nMcDavid was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers 1st overall in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Going into the draft, critics regarded McDavid with the potential to be the “The Next One”. Fans believed that if anyone were to catch Gretzky in points, it would be McDavid. The two players played in very different era’s though. Gretzky played during a time when there wasn’t much skill. Where as for McDavid, he plays in an era that’s solely based skill. The Oilers current captain has only played eight years in the NHL so far. If he were to pass The Great One, he would need to do some serious damage while he’s in his prime.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\n\ngretzky2 <- c(\"Goals\"=109, \"Assists\"=195)\nmcdavid2 <- c(\"Goals\"=61, \"Assists\"=109, 134)\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n    gretzky2,\n    rows = 10,\n   colors = c(\"blue\", \"orange\")) +\n   labs(\n      title= \"Gretzky's First Eight Seasons\",\n    subtitle= \"The Great One had a once in a lifetime prime.\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ),\nwaffle(\n  mcdavid2,\n  rows = 10,\n  color = c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"white\")) +\n  labs(\n      title= \"Mcdavid's First Eight Seasons\",\n    subtitle= \"Today's superstar has won five of the last seven NHL scoring titles.\"\n   ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nGoes to show just how dominant Wayne Gretzky was…\nTo get points, you need to contribute on goals. The more goals that’re being scored, the more point’s players are going to get. It would be very challenging for anyone to catch Gretzky. He played in a time where defense looked like rocket science. Since the game was evolved more into skill rather than strength, you would think today’s NHL would be scoring more than prior years? Goals scored per game has changed veriosuly over the years.\n\n\nCode\nggg <- read_csv(\"GoalsPerGame.csv\") %>% separate(Season, into=c(\"StartYear\", \"EndYear\"), sep=\"-\") %>% mutate(StartYear = as.numeric(StartYear))\n\neighty <- ggg %>% \n  filter(StartYear >= 1980 & StartYear <= 1989) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"1980s\")\n\nninety <- ggg %>% \n  filter(StartYear >= 1990 & StartYear <= 1999) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"1990s\")\n\ntwothousand <- ggg %>% \n   filter(StartYear >= 2000 & StartYear <= 2009) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"2000s\")\n\ntens <- ggg %>% \n   filter(StartYear >= 2010 & StartYear <= 2019) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"2010s\")\n\ntwentys <- ggg %>% \n   filter(StartYear >= 2019 & StartYear <= 2023) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"2020s\")\n\navggoalsbydecade <- bind_rows(eighty, ninety, twothousand, tens, twentys)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=avggoalsbydecade, aes(x=Order, y=G, group=Decade, color=Decade)) +\n geom_point(data=avggoalsbydecade, aes(x=Order, y=G, group=Decade, color=Decade), size = 2.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#FF4c00\",\"darkorange\", \"grey\", \"blue\", \"darkblue\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=8.5, y=3.8, label=\"Gretzky's era = Orange\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=8.5, y=3.1, label=\"McDavid's era = Blue\")) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Goals Per Game\",\n    title=\"Goals Per Game In Each Decade\",\n    subtitle=\"Scoring in the NHL has changed quite a bit over the years.\",\n    caption=\"Source: HockeyReference | By Keegan Olivera\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 24, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nGretzky’s prime against McDavid’s prime is almost an entire goal a game difference. This shows that scoring in the NHL has become more difficult. If you look back at Gretzky’s 200 point seasons, you can notice how that was when scoring in the NHL was at a record high. League scoring has been slowly trending upwards though.\nNow going back to the original question, will anyone pass Gretzky? It’s not impossible but it’s safe to say it’s highly unlikely. Not enough goals are being scored for there to be a real chance at the record. McDavid is known as the most skilled player in the game, if he can’t reach it, I find it hard to believe anyone else would.\n```"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Super Bowl is widely regarded as the biggest sporting event of the year in the United States. The two final teams remaining in the NFL battle it out for the Lombardi Trophy. Each year, the Super Bowl is the most watched television broadcast in the United States, currently averaging over 100 millions viewers the last decade. With that many people watching the same event, networks love the opportunity to host the big game.\nThe game has only been hosted on four major TV networks, those being CBS, NBC, FOX and ABC. The first Super Bowl dates back to 1967. Over 50 years later, over 50 super bowls have been broadcasted. With so many games being broadcasted, which TV network performs the best when they host the big game?\nEach network has had their fair share of hosting the game. CBS has hosted the most with 21. Following right behind is NBC with 19. FOX has hosted 10 while ABC has hosted the least with 7. Millions of people tune in every year, but some networks outperform others.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\n\ntv <- read_csv(\"SuperBowlData.csv\")\n\nfox <- tv %>%  filter(Network == \"FOX\")\n\nnbc <- tv %>%  filter(Network == \"NBC\")\n\ncbs <- tv %>%  filter(Network == \"CBS\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=tv, \n    aes(x=Rating, y=`Total Viewers`, size=1)\n    )+\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n  geom_point(\n    data=fox, \n    aes(x=Rating, y=`Total Viewers`, size=1),\n    color=\"yellow\",\n      alpha=.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n  geom_point(\n    data=nbc, \n    aes(x=Rating, y=`Total Viewers`, size=1),\n    color=\"red\",\n    alpha=.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n  geom_point(\n    data=cbs, \n    aes(x=Rating, y=`Total Viewers`, size=1),\n    color=\"darkblue\",\n      alpha=.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Rating\",\n    y=\"Total Viewers\",\n    title=\"How each network performs on Super Bowl Sundays.\",\n    subtitle=\"North America's biggest brings in millions of eyes to these TV Networks.\",\n    caption=\"Source: SportsMediaWatch | By Keegan Olivera\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    strip.text.x = element_text(size=10, angle=0, face=\"bold\"),\n          strip.text.y = element_text(size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n          strip.background = element_rect(colour=\"black\", fill=\"lightgrey\")\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nWith each network hosting a different amount of games, across a wide span of time, it’s hard to say there’s a clear winner. NBC has had some highly viewed games as well as some of the lowest viewed games.\nTo get a better idea of which TV network has been bringing in the most viewers, let’s take a look at the past 15 super bowls. Three networks have hosted the game over the past 15 years, 5 games each between NBC, FOX and CBS. ABC hasn’t broadcasted a Super Bowl since 2006 so they’ll be left out here. The last 15 big games have also been the 15 most watched games in the league’s history.\n\n\nCode\nlogs <- read_csv(\"fiveeach.csv\")\n\ncbs <- logs %>% filter(Network == \"CBS\")\n\nnbc <- logs %>%  filter(Network == \"NBC\")\n\nfox <- logs %>%  filter(Network == \"FOX\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=logs, aes(x=reorder(`Super Bowl`, `Total Viewers`), weight=`Total Viewers`, fill=Network))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"darkblue\", \"gold\", \"red\")) +\n  coord_flip()+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Super Bowl\",\n    y=\"Total Viewers\",\n    title=\"Which network has recently brought in the most Super Bowl viewers?\",\n    subtitle=\"Over the last 15 years, NBC, FOX and CBS have hosted the game five times.\",\n    caption=\"Source: SportsMediaWatch | By Keegan Olivera\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nNBC holds the crown for the most watched super bowl of all time. Super Bowl XLIX between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots averaged a record 114 million viewers back in 2015. However, just because they had the most viewed game of all time, doesn’t mean they average the most.\nFOX leads the charge over the past 15 years, averaging 109.6 million viewers per game they host. Looking at the chart, this makes sense. Three of the top five most watched games were hosted by FOX. NBC averaged 105.43 million with CBS, who hosted the most Super Bowls of all time, averaged 104.14 million.\nThese are only the past 15 years however, we’ve had over 50 years of the big game. Let’s look even deeper.\n\n\nCode\nsb <- read_csv(\"SuperBowlData.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 57 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): Super Bowl, Network\ndbl (3): Total Viewers, Rating, Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\ncbs <- sb %>% filter(Network == \"CBS\")\n\n\nnbc <- sb %>% filter(Network == \"NBC\")\n\n\nfox <- sb %>% filter(Network == \"FOX\")\n\n\nabc <- sb %>% filter(Network == \"ABC\")\n\n\n\nggplot() + geom_line(data=cbs, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=cbs, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`), method=\"lm\", color=\"darkblue\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n geom_line(data=nbc, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=nbc, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`), method=\"lm\", color=\"red\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n  geom_line(data=fox, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=fox, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`), method=\"lm\", color=\"gold\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n  geom_line(data=abc, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`))+\n  geom_smooth(data=abc, aes(x=Date, y=`Total Viewers`), method=\"lm\", color=\"black\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Network)+\n   scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)+\n   labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Total Viewers\",\n    title=\"TV viewership of the Super Bowl by each network.\",\n    subtitle=\"Each network averages millions of viewers for the big game.\",\n    caption=\"Source: SportsMediaWatch | By Keegan Olivera\"\n  ) +\n   theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    strip.text.x = element_text(size=10, angle=0, face=\"bold\"),\n          strip.text.y = element_text(size=18, face=\"bold\"),\n          strip.background = element_rect(colour=\"black\", fill=\"lightgrey\"))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nEach network’s viewers increased over the years, which is obviously a good thing. Averages for each network would vary quite a bit since networks like NBC and CBS were hosting games before TV’s were a common household item. Let’s calculate the averages of the last 10 Super Bowls each network hosted dating back to the early 90s.\nFOX: 98.99 Million Viewers NBC: 97.4 Million Viewers CBS: 94.15 Million Viewers ABC (Only 7 Games): 85 Million Viewers\nThere’s not one dominant network. FOX averages the most viewers with roughly 99 million. NBC and CBS don’t trail too far behind however."

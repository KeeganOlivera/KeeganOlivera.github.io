    "section": "",
    "text": "Hockey is often referred to as one of the more difficult sports to exist. You need to know how to skate with knives on your feet, shoot a rubber biscuit up to 90 mph all while 5 guys try to knock your head off. For Wayne Gretzky, he made hockey look as easy as blinking your eyes. Known as “The Great One”, Gretzky played 20 years in the world’s toughest hockey league, the NHL.\nBy the end of his marvelous career, Gretzky owned or shared 61 records in the NHL, the most in the history of the league. The record he’s most renown for is his career point total. In just under 1500 games, The Great One recorded a mind-boggiling 2,857 points. Every season he was putting up outrageous numbers. He reached the 200 point mark in a season four times. Not a single other player in the leagues history has been able to reach that number. For 20 years in the league, his numbers are off the charts.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ngreat <- read_csv(\"GretzkyStats.csv\")\n\nstats <- great %>%\n  filter(Tm == \"LAK\" |\n         Tm == \"EDM\" |\n         Tm == \"NYR\") %>%\n filter(PTS < 248) %>%\ngroup_by(Season) %>%\nsummarise(\n    TotalGoals = sum(G),\n    TotalAssists = sum(A)\n)\n\nbigwide <- stats %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Points\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=bigwide, aes(x=Season, weight=Points, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#041E42\", \"#FF4c00\"), labels=c(\"Assists\", \"Goals\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\",\n    y=\"Total Points\",\n    title=\"Wayne Gretzky's Season Stats\",\n    subtitle=\"The GOAT of Hockey played 20 seasons in the NHL.\",\n    caption=\"Source: HockeyReference | By Keegan Olivera\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 24, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n2,857 career points. 14 100-point seasons, EVERY season above a point-per-game. There’s a reason they call him “The Great One”.\nMany sport fans consider this record as “unbreakable”. The player closest to Gretzky, Jaromír Jágr, is still 936 points behind him. He was so good that if you subtracted all the goals in his career, he would still be first in all-time points. But hockey has been evolving over the last few years. In the late 90s and early 2000s, hockey was a grit and grind game. Teams were made up of big goons who could knock anyone on your team into an emergency room. The game has transitioned into skill over strength. Nobody in the league has the skill like Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid.\nMcDavid was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers 1st overall in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Going into the draft, critics regarded McDavid with the potential to be the “The Next One”. Fans believed that if anyone were to catch Gretzky in points, it would be McDavid. The two players played in very different era’s though. Gretzky played during a time when there wasn’t much skill. Where as for McDavid, he plays in an era that’s solely based skill. The Oilers current captain has only played eight years in the NHL so far. If he were to pass The Great One, he would need to do some serious damage while he’s in his prime.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\n\ngretzky2 <- c(\"Goals\"=109, \"Assists\"=195)\nmcdavid2 <- c(\"Goals\"=61, \"Assists\"=109, 134)\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n    gretzky2,\n    rows = 10,\n   title= \"Gretzky's First Eight Seasons\",\n   xlab=\"1 square = 5 Points\",\n   colors = c(\"blue\", \"orange\") \n    ),\nwaffle(mcdavid2,\n  rows = 10,\n  title=\"McDavid's First Eight Seasons\",\n  xlab=\"1 square = 5 Points\",\n  color = c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"white\")\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nGoes to show just how dominant Wayne Gretzky was…\nTo get points, you need to contribute on goals. The more goals that’re being scored, the more point’s players are going to get. It would be very challenging for anyone to catch Gretzky. He played in a time where defense looked like rocket science. Since the game was evolved more into skill rather than strength, you would think today’s NHL would be scoring more than prior years? Goals scored per game has changed veriosuly over the years.\n\n\nCode\nggg <- read_csv(\"GoalsPerGame.csv\") %>% separate(Season, into=c(\"StartYear\", \"EndYear\"), sep=\"-\") %>% mutate(StartYear = as.numeric(StartYear))\n\neighty <- ggg %>% \n  filter(StartYear >= 1980 & StartYear <= 1989) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"1980s\")\n\nninety <- ggg %>% \n  filter(StartYear >= 1990 & StartYear <= 1999) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"1990s\")\n\ntwothousand <- ggg %>% \n   filter(StartYear >= 2000 & StartYear <= 2009) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"2000s\")\n\ntens <- ggg %>% \n   filter(StartYear >= 2010 & StartYear <= 2019) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"2010s\")\n\ntwentys <- ggg %>% \n   filter(StartYear >= 2019 & StartYear <= 2023) %>%\n  arrange(StartYear) %>%\n  mutate(Order = row_number(), Decade = \"2020s\")\n\navggoalsbydecade <- bind_rows(eighty, ninety, twothousand, tens, twentys)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=avggoalsbydecade, aes(x=Order, y=G, group=Decade, color=Decade)) +\n geom_point(data=avggoalsbydecade, aes(x=Order, y=G, group=Decade, color=Decade), size = 2.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#FF4c00\",\"darkorange\", \"grey\", \"blue\", \"darkblue\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=8.5, y=3.8, label=\"Gretzky's era = Orange\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=8.5, y=3.1, label=\"McDavid's era = Blue\")) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Goals Per Game\",\n    title=\"Goals Per Game In Each Decade\",\n    subtitle=\"Scoring in the NHL has changed quite a bit over the years.\",\n    caption=\"Source: HockeyReference | By Keegan Olivera\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 24, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nGretzky’s prime against McDavid’s prime is almost an entire goal a game difference. This shows that scoring in the NHL has become more difficult. If you look back at Gretzky’s 200 point seasons, you can notice how that was when scoring in the NHL was at a record high. League scoring has been slowly trending upwards though.\nNow going back to the original question, will anyone pass Gretzky? It’s not impossible but it’s safe to say it’s highly unlikely. Not enough goals are being scored for there to be a real chance at the record. McDavid is known as the most skilled player in the game, if he can’t reach it, I find it hard to believe anyone else would.\n```"
